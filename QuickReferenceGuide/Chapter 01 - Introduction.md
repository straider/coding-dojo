=====================

# 1. Introduction

> [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_%28programming_language%29) is a historically influential imperative and procedural programming language, designed in 1968â€“1969 and published in 1970 by Niklaus Wirth as a small and efficient language intended to encourage good programming practices using structured programming and data structuring.

> A derivative known as Object Pascal designed for object-oriented programming was developed in 1985.

## 1.1. Roots

> The Pascal language was named for Blaise Pascal, French mathematician and pioneer in computer development.

> Pascal was developed for teaching programming as a systematic discipline and to develop reliable and efficient programs. Pascal is Algol-based language and includes many constructs of Algol. Algol 60 is a subset of Pascal.

Other languages that influenced Pascal's development were COBOL, Simula 67, and Wirth's own ALGOL W.

## 1.2. Recent History

- [ISO/IEC 10206:1991](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=18237): Extended Pascal;
- [ISO 7185:1990](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=13802): Pascal. Originally published in 1983, sets down the two original goals for Pascal:
  - make available a language suitable for teaching programming as a systematic discipline based on fundamental concepts clearly and naturally reflected by the language;
  - define a language whose implementations could be both reliable and efficient on then-available computers.
- Niklaus Wirth completed development of the original Pascal programming language in 1970. He based it upon the block structured style of the Algol programming language.

> In 1985 Larry Tesler, in consultation with Niklaus Wirth, defined Object Pascal and these extensions were incorporated in both the Lisa Pascal and Mac Pascal compilers.

- Turbo Pascal 5.5 had a large influence on the Pascal community, which began concentrating mainly on the IBM PC in the late 1980s;
- Apple Computer created its own Lisa Pascal for the Lisa Workshop in 1982 and ported this compiler to the Apple Macintosh in 1985;
- In the early 1980s, Watcom Pascal was developed, also for the IBM System 370;
- In the early 1980s, UCSD Pascal was ported to the Apple II and Apple III computers to provide a structured alternative to the BASIC interpreters;
- Pascal-P5, created outside the Zurich group, accepts the full Pascal language and includes ISO 7185 compatibility;
- A completely new compiler was completed in 1977: it offered a source-language diagnostic feature ( incorporating profiling, tracing and type-aware formatted postmortem dumps );
-  It is thought that Multum Pascal, which was completed in the summer of 1973, may have been the first 16-bit implementation;
- The first successful port of the CDC Pascal compiler to another mainframe was completed in 1972;
- CDC Pascal compiler was operational by mid-1970.

## 1.3. Authors

> Pascal, named in honor of the French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal, was developed by Niklaus Wirth. Before his work on Pascal, Wirth had developed Euler and ALGOL W and later went on to develop the Pascal-like languages [Modula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula), [Modula-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modula-2) and [Oberon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberon_%28programming_language%29).

## 1.4. Why?

> Initially, Pascal was largely, but not exclusively, intended to teach students structured programming. A generation of students used Pascal as an introductory language in undergraduate courses. Variants of Pascal have also frequently been used for everything from research projects to PC games and embedded systems.

> Pascal has grown in popularity in the teaching and academics arena for various reasons:
- Easy to learn;
- Structured language;
- It produces transparent, efficient and reliable programs;
- It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms.

> Pascal was the primary high-level language used for development in the Apple Lisa, and in the early years of the Macintosh. Parts of the original Macintosh operating system were hand-translated into Motorola 68000 assembly language from the Pascal sources. The typesetting system TeX by Donald E. Knuth was written in WEB, the original literate programming system, based on DEC PDP-10 Pascal, while applications like Total Commander, Skype and Macromedia Captivate were written in Delphi ( [Object Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Pascal) ).

> Object Pascal ( Embarcadero Delphi ) is still used for developing Windows applications but also has the ability to cross compile the same code to Mac, iOS and Android. Another cross-platform version called Free Pascal, with the Lazarus IDE, is popular with Linux users since it also offers write once, compile anywhere development. CodeTyphon is a variant of Lazarus with more preinstalled packages and cross compilers.

## 1.5. Features

> Pascal has the following features:
- Pascal is a strongly typed language;
- It offers extensive error checking;
- It offers several data types like arrays, records, files and sets;
- It offers a variety of programming structures;
- It supports structured programming through functions and procedures;
- It supports object oriented programming.

- Introduced concepts and mechanisms which ( on top of ALGOL's scalars and arrays ) enabled programmers to define their own complex ( structured ) datatypes;
- Made it easier to build dynamic and recursive data structures such as lists, trees and graphs;
- Important features included were records, enumerations, subranges, dynamically allocated variables with associated pointers, and sets;
- To make this possible and meaningful, Pascal has a strong typing on all objects, which means that one type of data cannot be converted or interpreted as another without explicit conversions. Similar mechanisms are standard in many programming languages today;
- Pascal, like many programming languages of today ( but unlike most languages in the C family ), allows:
  - nested procedure definitions to any level of depth;
  - most kinds of definitions and declarations inside subroutines ( procedures and functions ).

> Pascal enables a very simple and coherent syntax where a complete **program** is syntactically nearly identical to a single **procedure** or **function** ( except for the heading, which has one of these three keywords ).

Quick Reference Guide
=====================

# 2. Getting Started

> A Pascal program basically consists of the following parts:
- Program name
- Uses command
- Type declarations
- Constant declarations
- Variables declarations
- Functions declarations
- Procedures declarations
- Main program block
- Statements and Expressions within each block
- Comments

## 2.1. Comments

Single-line comments start with "(*" and end with "*)". Multi-line comments are enclosed within curly brackets and asterisks as "{* ... *}". Pascal also allows single-line comments enclosed within curly brackets "{ ... }".

```pascal
(* Single-line Comment *)
{ Another single-line comment }

{* 
This is
a multi-line
comment 
*}
```

## 2.2. Statements

>  Every block in Pascal is enclosed within a **begin** statement and an **end** statement. However, the end statement indicating the end of the main program is followed by a full stop "." instead of semicolon ";".

> Pascal programs are made of statements. Each statement specifies a definite job of the program. These jobs could be declaration, assignment, reading data, writing data, taking logical decisions, transferring program flow control, etc.

## 2.3. Keywords and Identifiers

Following is a list of reserved words available in Pascal:

|       |          |       |           |       |
|-------|----------|-------|-----------|-------|
| and   | downto   | if    | or        | then  |
| array | else     | in    | packed    | to    |
| begin | end      | label | procedure | type  |
| case  | file     | mod   | program   | until |
| const | for      | nil   | record    | var   |
| div   | function | not   | repeat    | while |
| do    | goto     | of    | set       | with  |

> Pascal is a case non-sensitive language, which means you can write your variables, functions and procedure in either case.

> The Pascal character set consists of:
- All upper case letters (A-Z);
- All lower case letters (a-z);
- All digits (0-9);
- Special symbols, such as - + * / := , . ;. () [] = {} ` and white space.

> The entities in a Pascal program like variables and constants, types, functions, procedures and records, etc., have a name or identifier.

> An identifier is a sequence of letters and digits, beginning with a letter. Special symbols and blanks must not be used in an identifier.

coding-dojo / MinimalNoOp
=========================

A very simple dojo, with almost no purpose whatsoever except showing off the minimal set of lines of code for a program that does nothing ( No Operation ).

# 1. Goals

- Demonstrate several types of "no operation" programs in the language;
- May help to start feeling the verbosity level of a language - since it does nothing then it should have no lines at all and still run.

# 2. Variants

## 2.1. Empty Lines of Code

- Does the language allow an empty source file?
- Does it compile and run?

## 2.2. Comments Only

Demonstrate the possible variants of comments ( one-liner, multiple lines, doctest, ... ) that the language allows, without actually doing anything.

## 2.3. Shebang First Line

The _shebang_ line is used in Unix flavored operating systems to state what's the interpreter to use to execute the given script, without having to explicitly type it in front of the script filename.

**Note**: this is usually only allowed in interpreted languages.

## 2.4. Main Program

This should produce an executable for compiled languages or be the shortest possible script for interpreted languages ( without the shebang line ).

## 2.5. Do Nothing Module / Library / Package

This should produce a library or module or package that does nothing.

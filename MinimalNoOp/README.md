coding-dojo / MinimalNoOp
=========================

A very simple dojo, with almost no purpose whatsoever except showing off the minimal set of lines of code for a program that does nothing ( No Operation ).

# 1. Goals

- Demonstrate several types of "no operation" programs in the language;
- May help to start feeling the verbosity level of a language - since it does nothing then it should have no lines at all and still run.

# 2. Variants

## 2.1. Empty Lines of Code

- Does the language allow an empty source file?
- Does it compile and run?

## 2.2. Main Program

This should produce an executable for compiled languages or be the shortest possible script for interpreted languages ( without the shebang line ).

## 2.3. Do Nothing Module / Library / Package

This should produce a library or module or package that does nothing.

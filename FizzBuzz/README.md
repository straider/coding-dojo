coding-dojo / FizzBuzz
======================

Dojo to register different programming paradigms of FizzBuzz Challenge.

## Goals

- Gain experience with if..else and ternary operator;
- Take advantage of String concatenation;
- Learn to format output: number of characters, padding, ...;
- Gain experience with collections and foreach;
- Compare Programming Paradigms in a simple context;
- Gain traction in Object Oriented Design and Programming;
- Gain traction in following S.O.L.I.D. principles;
- Gain traction by applying Design Patterns.

## Variants

**Note**: in all variants and versions, if possible, the output of the numeric value to the console should be formatted to 4 digits, padded with 0s on the left.

### Procedural

#### Requirements

- Iterate numbers from 1 to 100;
- Output each number in a distinct line, to the console;
- Unless the number is, in order:
  - If divisible by 3 then output string "Fizz" instead;
  - If divisible by 5 then output string "Buzz" instead;
  - If divisible by 3 and by 5 then output string "FizzBuzz" instead.

#### Constraints

- v1: using only if..else;
- v2: using ternary operator and string concatenation;

----

### Object Oriented

#### Requirements

- Iterate numbers from 1 to 100;
- Output each number in a distinct line, to the console;
- Unless the number is, in order:
  - If divisible by 3 then output string "Fizz" instead;
  - If divisible by 5 then output string "Buzz" instead;
  - If divisible by 3 and by 5 then output string "FizzBuzz" instead.

#### Constraints

- v1: using object PrimeWord that after instantiated with a number and a word returns the word if a value is divisible by number else returns an empty string;
- v2: using object PrimeWord, ordered list and Iterator;
- v3: using object NumberWord and a Decorator for each pair;
- v4: use steps in Chain Of Responsibility.

----

### Functional

#### Requirements

- Iterate numbers from 1 to 100;
- Output each number in a distinct line, to the console;
- Unless the number is, in order:
  - If divisible by 3 then output string "Fizz" instead;
  - If divisible by 5 then output string "Buzz" instead;
  - If divisible by 3 and by 5 then output string "FizzBuzz" instead.

#### Constraints

- v1: using pattern matching;
- v2: using high order functions;
- v3: using recursion.

----

### Notes

The Design Patterns **Decorator** and **Chain of Responsibility** are not properly implemented, although the end result is ok. Why?

#### Decorators

A decorator adds behavior to an existing object, without changing the object. It also descends from the same base object as the object it decorates, meaning that where in code that object is required then the code can be changed to use the decorator.

A decorator does not depend or keep track of results from other decorators.

And this is where the implementation here in this dojo fails: the decorator must handle state from other decorators, which is kept in the array of words.

#### Chain of Responsibility

A chain is made up of "links" that descend from a base object. Meaning that each link in the chain should offer the same set of methods. If one link isn't responsible for the implementation of a method it then passes that evocation to the next link, and so on up until the last link the chain.

Each link, called here in this dojo as step, does not depend or keep track of results from other links.

And this is where these steps fail to properly implement the design pattern: the base object handles state of all links in an array of words.

### Challenge

Add another prime number pair ( 7, Dazz ) and compare coding effort of each variant and version to adapt to this new requirement.

#### Procedural

- V1 is very verbose and prone to human error, more so as more pairs are added;
- V2 is the easiest to adapt to new pairs: just requires a new line of code: ```line += ( i % [PRIME] == 0 ) ? "[WORD]" : "";```.

#### Object Oriented

- V1 is the second best to adapt to new pairs: requires 2 new lines of code for each pair;
- V2 is also a second best to adapt and could be even better if instead of hard-coded instances would process a map of pairs. It would then be the best of all, even better than Procedural V1;
- V3 requires one new line of code for each pair and new Decorator class ( to follow this Design Pattern convention );
- V4 requires 3 new lines of code for each pair plus changing one line of code ( introduce a new step in the chain ).

#### Functional

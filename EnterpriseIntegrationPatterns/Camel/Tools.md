# OSGi Framework Implementations

> [Apache Felix](http://felix.apache.org/) is a community effort to implement the OSGi Framework and Service platform and other interesting OSGi-related technologies under the Apache license. The OSGi specifications originally targeted embedded devices and home services gateways, but they are ideally suited for any project interested in the principles of modularity, component-orientation, and/or service-orientation.
- [Equinox](http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/) is an implementation of the OSGi core framework specification, a set of bundles that implement various optional OSGi services and other infrastructure for running OSGi-based systems. The Equinox OSGi core framework implementation is used as the reference implementation and as such it implements all the required features of the latest OSGi core framework specification.
- [Concierge](http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/rt.concierge/) is an alternative implementation to Equinox of the OSGi core framework and can serve as the sandbox for experimental work on the OSGi core which can later be adopted by Equinox.

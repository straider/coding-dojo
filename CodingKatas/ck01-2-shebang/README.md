# Shebang Line

The _shebang_ line is used in Unix flavored operating systems to state what's the interpreter to use to execute the given script, without having to explicitly type it in front of the script filename.

**Note**: this is usually only allowed in interpreted languages.

Demonstrate the possible variants of shebang lines that just outputs the interpreter version number.

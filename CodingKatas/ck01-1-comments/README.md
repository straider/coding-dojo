# Comments

Demonstrate the possible variants of comments ( one-liner, multiple lines, doctest, ... ) that the language allows, without actually doing anything.

- One line comment starts with ```#```;
- Multiple line comments start with ``=begin```` and end with ````=cut```;
- HereDoc notation starts with ```<<IDENTIFIER``` and end with ```IDENTIFIER```, which can be single quoted or double quoted. When is single quoted than no interpolation is possible.

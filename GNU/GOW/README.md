## 1.1. Goals & Objectives

> Gow (Gnu On Windows) is the lightweight alternative to Cygwin. It uses a 
convenient Windows installer that installs about 130 extremely useful 
open source UNIX applications compiled as native win32 binaries. It is 
designed to be as small as possible, about 10 MB, as opposed to Cygwin 
which can run well over 100 MB depending upon options.
